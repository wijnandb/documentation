The Company section deals with all the pages and actions a Company can perform in the application.

A company is an entity that can be hired to perform an after-school activity. It is represented by its owner (which is a User with the Company profile set to True).

Often, a Company owner is also a Teacher, which is the person that actually performs the Activity.

Actions a Company can perform:

- agree to a Contract
- assign a Teacher to an Activity
