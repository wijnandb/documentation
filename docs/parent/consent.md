The [consent page](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/parent/consent/) is in the wrong position, we should show that in a different moment, right after login. 
Subsequently a user should not see it anymore when their consent cookie is still there. 

We also need to translate this page to English.
