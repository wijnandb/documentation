Role: organizer, schoolmanager

In this first phase, an organizer looks through the current offering. 
For this, we need to present all Activities and make it easy to search and filter.

Ideally, we show them everything there is to show.
So, let's start with all Activities (auto scroll to improve loading speed) and a search-box.
Filter on type of activity.

If the user selects an activity, then we show them the activity title, descirption and type of activity. We would also like to show them the Companies that offer that Activity and the number of times such an Activity has been orgnaized.
