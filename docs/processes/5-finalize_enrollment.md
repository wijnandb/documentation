After the match between the supply and demand has been made, we have the ingredients for a contract:

- a company
- a representative who will perform the activity
- a location
- a weekday
- a timeslot
- an activity
- a number of dates

We also have a tariff (comes with the company), so adding these all together creates a contract.

Now we want the company to agree to the contract. 

Currently, this can be done in the web-application. A company owner can either agree to the contract, or disagree.
