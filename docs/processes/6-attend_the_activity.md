To attend the activity, the participants and the activity leader need to know when and where the activity is.

Special attention needs to be paid to cancelled events. Informing both the (parents of the) participants and the activity leader is important and needs to be done timely.

Another aspect of this phase is recording attendance by the activity leader. By recording attendance, we gain insight into the popularity of each activity, data we will also need to show in the reporting phase.

Another aspect is that we can inform people (sc hoolmanager, parents) when a child is unexpectly not attending.

Which brings us to yet another part of this process: we want a Parent and/or a schoolmanager to be able to record a (future) absence of a Child. That way, an activity leader is informed about the absence of that child on that day.
