Final step: reporting.

What has been done with the money that has been provided?

Where did it go?
Who benefited from it?
How many children participated?
What was the Attendance percentage?

A lot of questions can be asked and answered in the reporting phase.

Ideally, we create an interactive report with stunning graphs, which enables people to look at everything they are interested in. Creating nice interactive charts might give them the insight they are after and hopefully a warm feeling inside, but it also possible that a client is more interested in an old fashioned PDF.
