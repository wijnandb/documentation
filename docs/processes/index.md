In this application, there are different phases. In each of the phases, different peopel with different roles are involved. 

In each of the phases, a cretain task has to be performed. To perform this task, we create pages and interfaces.

We are going through each phase separately, looking carefully at the task and outcome that needs to be genreated from that phase, so we can optimize the UX per page.
