View which activities the child or children are enrolled in. 

[Current page](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/parent/) is not suited for mobile. Also it isn't clear which information is found where. 

[New proposal](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/parent/children/) shows which activities each child has on which day and time. 

We still need to figure out how to connect this to the other requirements, like [viewing personal data]() and editing that data.

The link to [enroll in new activities]() is not working at the moment, what should that page look like?
