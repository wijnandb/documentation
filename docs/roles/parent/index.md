The parent has relative little to do in this application.

Important to know is how the Parent is linked to their Child (called Students in our system).
The information of Students is uploaded by the Schoolmanager. The information contains (among other things) the e-mail adddress(es) of the Parent(s). If the Parent creates an account on our application, all the Students who have their e-mail address associated with them, are linked to that PArent.

When the Parent logs in, they see all their linked children.

That's why the Parent needs to create an account using the same e-mail address they have listed in the Student Admininistration System at school.
