Quite a big role, the Schoolmanager (also called Internal Coordinator or IC'er) has.

One of the important things is uploading the Student information. By doing this, they provide up to date information on their Students and also contact information of their parents.
When Parents sign up for the application, they get linked to their children if the emailaddress they use is the same as the emailaddress the school has registered for that Parent.

Schoolmanagers are also responsible for determining which Students participates in which Activity. They work together woth the Organizer to create a program for the Students of their School.
