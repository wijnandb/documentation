# Visitor pages

All the pages that do not require to be logged in will be referenced as "Visitor pages". 
They include the login and forgot password pages, becuase you can access these without being logged in.

Other pages we want to display:
- [homepage](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/): both in English and in Dutch
- [activities](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/activity/): currently showing all of them, do we want to keep doing that?
- [About](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/about/)
- [FAQ](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/faq/)
- [Aanmelden](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/accounts/signup/)
- [Login](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/accounts/login/)
- [Forgot password](https://acceptatiebredeschoolzuidoost.herokuapp.com/accounts/password/reset/)

On the "Aanmelden" page: I think we need to explain more and better how the integration with the Student Administration System works.
