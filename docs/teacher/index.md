A Teacher is a User with the role of Teacher. They are the people who go the school and guide the Students during an Activity.

Before they can be in front of a group of Students, their "VOG", their "Eligibility document",  has to be verified. This is a document issued by the Dutch government to indicate that a background check has been carried out and the person has been deemed fit to work with children.

The main activity a Teacher performs is leading the activity.

On the platform, these are the tasks they can perform:

- accept invitations from a Company to work for them (this means the company can asssign activities to them)
- indicate their availability to lead activities: which days, which activities, which yeargroups
- upload their Eligibility document
- see the activities they have been assigned to (including date, time, location)
- mark attendance for participating students
- mark the Portfolio for each particiapting Student
